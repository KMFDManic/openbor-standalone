 In 2004, Senile Team released Beats of Rage, a free beat-'em-up
 for DOS inspired by SEGA's Streets of Rage series and using
 sprites from SNK Playmore's King of Fighters series. The game 
 spread only by word of mouth, but it nonetheless amassed popularity
 very quickly. Senile Team soon released an edit pack allowing anyone 
 interested to create a module for the BOR engine. In 2005, Kirby2000
 asked Senile Team to open the source code to BOR. They agreed,
 and OpenBOR was born. Development on the engine was continued by the
 community, and still is to this day.
